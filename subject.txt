Introduction
You have recently moved to the Lyon metropolitan area, known for its rich culture,
amazing attractions and beautiful landscapes. You’ve decided to purchase your dream
house and settle in Lyon. However, you are well aware that real estate prices in Lyon
can be quite high. This problem set will help you calculate how long it will take to
save enough money for a down payment on a house in Lyon, taking into account various
financial factors.
2 Part I: Calculating Time to Save
In this part, you will calculate the number of months it will take you to save enough
money to secure the down-payment on your dream home in Lyon. Consider the following
assumptions:
1. The cost of your dream home in Lyon is represented as total cost.
2. The portion of the cost needed for a down payment is portion down payment,
which is 25% (0.25).
3. You currently have saved an initial amount, current savings, which starts at €0.
4. Your wise investments yield an annual return of r, which is 4% (0.04).
5. Your annual salary in Lyon is annual salary.
6. You plan to dedicate a certain percentage of your monthly salary for savings, rep-
resented as portion saved. This value should be in decimal form (e.g., 0.1 for
10%).

7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your
investments plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).
Write a program in Python to calculate the number of months required to save for a
down payment. Ensure that your main variables are represented as floats.
Your program should prompt the user to enter the following variables:
1. The starting annual salary in Lyon (annual salary).
2. The portion of salary to be saved each month, in decimal form (portion saved).
3. The cost of your dream home in Lyon (total cost).
Include appropriate comments in your code for the sake of clarity.
Test case 1
Enter your annual salary in Lyon: 60000
Enter the portion of salary to be saved, as a decimal: 0.10
Enter the cost of your dream home in Lyon: 400000
Number of months: 87
Test case 2
Enter your annual salary in Lyon: 75000
Enter the portion of salary to be saved, as a decimal: 0.15
Enter the cost of your dream home in Lyon: 600000
Number of months: 106
3 Part II: Salary Raise
Based on your solution from Part I, you will now take into account semi-annual salary
raises. Your program should include these additional steps:
1. Ask the user to input a semi-annual salary raise as semi annual raise, represented
as a decimal percentage.
2. Starting from the 6th month, increase your salary by that percentage. Apply the
same raise every 6 months.
Modify your existing program to calculate the number of months required to save for a
down payment while considering the semi-annual salary raise. Assume that your invest-
ments still earn a return of 4%, and the required down payment percentage is 25%.
Your program should prompt the user to enter the following variables:
1. The starting annual salary in Lyon (annual salary).
2. The portion of salary to be saved each month, in decimal form (portion saved).
3. The cost of your dream home in Lyon (total cost).
4. The semi-annual salary raise, in decimal form (semi annual raise).
Ensure that your code maintains the format shown in the test cases provided.

Test case 1
Enter your starting annual salary in Lyon: 65000
Enter the portion of salary to be saved, as a decimal: 0.12
Enter the cost of your dream home in Lyon: 500000
Enter the semi-annual raise, as a decimal: 0.04
Number of months: 105
Test case 2
Enter your starting annual salary in Lyon: 80000
Enter the portion of salary to be saved, as a decimal: 0.10
Enter the cost of your dream home in Lyon: 750000
Enter the semi-annual raise, as a decimal: 0.05
Number of months: 142
4 Part III: Finding the Right Savings Rate
In this part, you will determine the best savings rate required to afford a down payment on
a €1 million house in Lyon within 36 months. You will use bisection search to efficiently
calculate this rate. Assume the following:
1. Your semi-annual raise in Lyon is 7% (0.07).
2. Your investments yield an annual return of 4% (0.04).
3. The down payment is 25% (0.25) of the cost of the house, which is €1,000,000.
Your goal is to find the savings rate that gets you close to the down payment amount
within €100.
Write a program in Python to calculate the best savings rate as a function of your starting
salary in Lyon. Implement bisection search to find this rate efficiently. Keep track of the
number of steps it takes for your bisection search to finish.
Your program should prompt the user to enter the starting annual salary in Lyon and
provide the best savings rate, rounded to four decimal places. If it’s not possible to save
for the down payment in 36 months, your program should display a message notifying
the user.
Make sure that your code adheres to the format shown in the test cases provided.
Test case 1
Enter the starting salary in Lyon: 50000
Best savings rate: 0.2278
Steps in bisection search: 11
3
Test case 2
Enter the starting salary in Lyon: 90000
Best savings rate: 0.1743
Steps in bisection search: 12
Test case 3
Enter the starting salary in Lyon: 35000
It is not possible to pay the down payment in three years.
